@1    = ~Ah, I'm sorry. We won't stand in your way. Come on, children, don't stand in the way of these people.~
@2    = ~There! That is the culprit!~
@3    = ~Ah, here you are. But... but where are my children? Help!~
@4    = ~Ah, here you are. I am so grateful. Thank you again, dear stranger. Sarah, Tom, I am back! I see you didn't manage to make Sarah wear her coat, either. Don't worry, that's how she is. *sigh*~
@5    = ~I hope you accomplished what you had in mind.~
@6    = ~So, how about my reward?~
@7    = ~Please don't tell anybody about this. I will lose my reputation as a monster fighter if word of this gets out!~
@8    = ~Take those brats and leave as fast as possible. I can't stand the sight of you any more!~
@9    = ~What an unfriendly person. I thought better of you! Well, I guess I won't tell people about your help, then. Still, you have been a great help to me. Farewell.~
//@10   
@11   = ~Re... reward? I... I didn't... See, I don't have any money. I had to go and talk to their dad... in private. He will pay for our transfer to my family in Amn, and that's all. Bastard! Oops, I am sorry. Children, that is a bad word, don't you ever use it! Could... could I offer you something else?~
@12   = ~Don't worry, really. I see you have enough problems as it is. Farewell.~
@13   = ~*smirk* How about some private services, hmm?~
@14   = ~How dare you! I thought better of you! Children, off we go. And quick!~
//@15   
@16   = ~Well, yes, in a way... See, I don't have any money. I had to go and talk to their dad... in private. He will pay for our transfer to my family in Amn, and that's all. Bastard! Oops, I am sorry. Children, that is a bad word, don't you ever use it!~
@17   = ~Well, I guess we have to go now. It might be hard to understand why I can't take them along to their dad... Thank you again so much for your help! I'll tell everyone of your kind generosity.~
@18   = ~I thank you. You have been a great help, even though it might be hard to understand why I can't take them along to their dad... I'll tell everyone how helpful you have been.~
@19   = ~Oh! That is a hard one. I would love to have told everybody how helpful you were, but yes, I can keep it to myself if you wish.~
@20   = ~Well, I guess we have to go now. Again, thank you so much for your help! I won't tell anybody... at least I will try not to.~
@21   = ~Ah, I'm sorry. We won't stand in your way. Come on, children!~
@22   = ~You look as if something is troubling you. Can I help you in any way?~
@23   = ~Nice children you have there.~
@24   = ~Good day to you.~
@25   = ~Ah, don't you worry. I... Sarah! Leave Tom alone! No, I already said you can't have it! ...well, it's children, you know. They always... Tom! Don't *you* start it now. For heaven's sake! *sigh* Thank you very much, but I don't want to waste your time.~
@26   = ~Ah, haha, yes, they are lovely, aren't they? Tom is two and Sarah is already four, and... Sarah! Stop it right now! ...ah, she's so much like her father. *sigh* Well, anyway, thank you for your interest, but I don't want to waste your time.~
@27   = ~Yes, my dear?~
@28   = ~I couldn't help but overhear your sighing. It seems you need someone who would babysit your children, don't you?~
@29   = ~Nothing, good day.~
@30   = ~Well, I met a young woman at the Carnival who was looking for some kind of job. I don't know about her... you'll have to look for yourself.~
@31   = ~I am a stranger, but seeing you in such a need, maybe I could take care of your children?~
@32   = ~Maybe I could take care of your children.~
@33   = ~Nothing new. If I find someone I'll let you know.~
@34   = ~Nothing.~
@35   = ~Well, yes. That is actually true. You see, I have a very important appointment where I most surely can't take any children along... You aren't asking because you know someone appropriate, by any chance?~
@36   = ~No, but if I meet someone I'll let you know.~
@37   = ~I am sorry, but I have no time for that now.~
@38   = ~Me? Dear gods, no.~
@39   = ~Really? Hmm, I could give it a try. Thank you!~
@40   = ~Oh, it's you again... I talked to the lady you showed me. Thank you again, but...~
@41   = ~But what? Was there a problem?~
@42   = ~Great. Everything is sorted then. Good day to you.~
@43   = ~I don't want to hear any more babysitting stories, thank you.~
@44   = ~She... well, she wasn't what I was looking for. Call me picky, but it's my children, you know... It's hard to give them to strangers. *sigh*~
@45   = ~I am a stranger too, but seeing you in such a need, maybe I could take care of your children?~
@46   = ~It's okay. Maybe I'll find someone else. I will let you know if that happens.~
@47   = ~Gods, it's hard to make it right for you, woman! Leave me alone then.~
@48   = ~Ah, haha, thank you. I am desperate, but not *that*... I... I wanted to say, it's very kind of you, but I can't possibly accept. It's only that... I don't know you at all, neither did I hear much of you... Thank you again, but... no.~
//@49   
@50   = ~Ah, haha, thank you. I am desperate, but not *that*... I... I wanted to say, it's very kind of you, and I noticed the child that is with you, but I can't possibly accept. It's only that... I don't know you at all, neither did I hear much of you... Thank you again, but... no.~
@51   = ~You would? I... I mean, it wouldn't take longer than half an hour... They are really lovely, only a bit... well, they keep you busy. Oh, I think I would love to accept your offer. You seem such a decent person... I've heard a lot of good about you lately. Tell me when you are ready, and I will leave the kids in your care. It won't take longer than half an hour, I promise. Just be prepared... well, you won't have much time to do anything else during that time.~
@52   = ~I will be ready right away. Sarah, Tom, would you stay with me for a moment while your mommy is away?~
@53   = ~I have to do something else first. I will come back to you.~
//@54   
@55   = ~Ah, maybe I was a bit too enthusiastic. I don't think I want to do this.~
//@56   
@57   = ~I am ready to take the children now, if you wish. Sarah, Tom, would you stay with me for a moment while your mommy is away?~
@58   = ~I need some more time. I'll come back to you later.~
@59   = ~Are you still looking for someone? I'll let you know if I find someone.~
@60   = ~Would you trust me now if I said I would babysit your children?~
@61   = ~Are you still looking for someone? Are you sure you wouldn't trust me, if I say I would take care of them?~
@62   = ~I changed my mind and am ready to take the children now if you wish. Sarah, Tom, would you stay with me for a moment while your mommy is away?~
@63   = ~Nothing. Good day.~
@64   = ~I am sorry... but no.~
@65   = ~You have no idea how much your kindness is helping me. Ah, before I forget: here is Tom's bottle, and his toy. Just give it to him if he feels sad. Here is Sarah's bottle, and her doll. Here is her coat. She refused to wear it. *sigh* Maybe you can talk some sense into her. Ah, and some sweets, usually I don't give them that much, but... well, it'll keep them busy, for a while at least. Children, you better behave yourselves! Mommy will be back soon. Bye, my darlings! Thank you so much indeed. I'll expect you to stay in this area, just, you know, to be sure.~

@114  = ~I'll tell Mommy, Tom!~

@116  = ~Yes, do that. And until then, be quiet, both of you.~

@130  = ~Would you listen to my answer?~

@405  = ~Good gods. Brats!~
@406  = ~Didn't I say get *lost*? Why do I see you standing here still?~
@407  = ~Hel-looo? Anyone there? I said *get lost*!~
@408  = ~What if I say get *lost*, huh?~
@409  = ~No problem.~
@410  = ~N... No, forgive me, stranger.~
@411  = ~I... I am sorry. We are only waiting here, and are no trouble for anyone. Please, just leave us be.~
@412  = ~Do I have to use force?~
@413  = ~If I hear any of those brats complain again, there will be trouble.~
@414  = ~What? No... no! I am going. I was hoping to get... I mean, for all the way to Amn, I would need more... But I am daydreaming. It has to work out like this. Come on, children, we are leaving. Come on...~
@415  = ~Why are you scaring me so? I have enough trouble as it is!~
@416  = ~Hey! But isn't that the one the frightened mother described. Hey, you need to learn a lesson, stranger. Bullying a mother with children so! Come on, lads, this should be fun.~

@417  = ~The curiosity and liveliness of young children is unbelievable. Such spirit!~
@418  = ~My line! That was my line, female.~
@419  = ~I... am surprised at the manifoldness of occasions at which I see the profits of my life-long training in patience, I have to add.~
@420  = ~"They'll keep you busy", indeed! Did that girl ever stop talking?~
@421  = ~I mean... have *we* been like this when we were young?~
@422  = ~No.~
@423  = ~Well, according to my aunt I was... er, worse.~
@424  = ~I would be dead, had I been like this.~
@425  = ~Although it *does* shed a completely new light on the severe austerity of the Handmaidens of Lolth who raised me and my brothers.~
@426  = ~You know, it's the same with birds. The smallest usually makes the loudest "cheep".~
@427  = ~The loudest cheep comes from the hen before I turn its head.~
@428  = ~<CHARNAME>, if I ever have to witness something like this again, I'll regret we combined forces. Meaning, you will regret we combined forces.~

@429  = ~I don't know, <CHARNAME>... The woman seemed to be quite unhappy. Even if you don't feel like helping, it could well be there would have been a reward in there, somewhere.~
@430  = ~Hmph. Unnecessary unfriendly acts like these usually end in counter actions of some sort.~
@431  = ~I wished we wouldn't have bullied her so. There is not much help a mother c-can expect from strangers.~ 
@432  = ~On the contrary, Khalid. A mother gets help from all unexpected places, especially with small children.~ 
@433  = ~She surely didn't get help from us.~
@434  = ~That mother got help from us - seems she was undecided as to when it would be best to leave this place. Now she correctly realized it is time to go.~
@435  = ~Oh, I love it if we help others! I feel all warm inside.~
@436  = ~That's probably because ye haven't gone behind the bushes in time, Xzar.~
@437  = ~Are we finished here? Can we go? (And quick, I might add.)~
@438  = ~*snort* You should work on balancing your powers, <CHARNAME>, if you can't keep your temper because of a mother with children. They where a nuisance, but no reason to get into conflict with the soldiers guarding this town. There is a much easier way to achieve this.~
@439  = ~<CHARNAME>, you *did* notice all the Amnish soldiers walking this place before deciding to threaten that woman away, yes? I am just asking.~
@440  = ~Hm, why did you scare them, <CHARNAME>? Now I cannot do it. Ah, frightened children's eyes. A lovely sight.~
@441  = ~Never underestimate a mother. As much as I loath the obligations that she put herself into by having those children, I respect the will of a mother to fight for her offspring.~
@442  = ~*spits* There was not much will in that woman to stand up for her children. They are gone, now let us go.~
@443  = ~Nothing of importance here! Why are we waiting?~
