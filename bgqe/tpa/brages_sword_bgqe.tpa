we don't care whether you put all your effort into the task we ordered you to do.

It is your oversight the whole thing nearly failed. You are lucky as it is that this fool went back to Nashkel at all, so the gold we spent on this blade with its special curse is not lost alltogether. No, you will not receive the second amount of the payment. You can still keep the original sword that Brage was supposed to receive. That is enough compensation. Be glad we don't hunt you down.
