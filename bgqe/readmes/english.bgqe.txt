			Baldur's Gate Mini Quests and Encounters
					Modification 
				for BGT, BG:EE, and EET
					by jastey 


Baldur's Gate Mini Quests and Encounters Modification (BGQE) is a mod for BGT, BG:EE, and EET, adding several small quests and encounters to the game. Vanilla BG1 without TotSC is no longer officially supported, but it should still work for it.

The duration of the game time added by this mod is approximately 30 to 60 minutes, depending on playing style.

Since Version 9, the Bjornin Extention is moved to the RE BG1 mod (Romantic Encouters for BG1). That is where it belonged all along.

Install this mod before bg1npc project. Otherwise, some reply options are gone. 

Since Version 30, the quest extensions by Brage's Redemption mod with additional hints and journal entries are now included in bgqe.
The mod "Brage's Redemption" (v10 and higher) requires bgqe's component "Brage's Sword" as a prerequirement before Brage can be taken into the party, i.e. if both mods are installed, BGQE has to be installed before Brage's Redemption.


DESCRIPTION

1. Slime Quest 
------
This quest is located in Beregost. If you pass one of the houses in the northwest, a woman dressed in red should approach you. There are some strange things going on in the house of her neighbor, and she wants your help.

This release revises the quest to meet known compatibility issues and adds a (more) evil quest solution. 


2. Family Treasure Quest 
------
This quest is also located in Beregost. If you go into another house in the northwest, you will meet a strange couple. They obviously have a serious problem, but haven't talked to each other for some time now. Although it seems that they aren't interested in talking to you either, it might just be that you can solve the riddle and ease their worries... or betray them and ruin the family completely.


3. Babysitting in Nashkel, including Carnival Encounter 
------
This quest occurs in Nashkel. Did you meet the desperate mother of two little children? She has something important to do, and is in great need of a trustworthy person who will watch over her children while she is away. So, fearless monster fighter, will you be ready for this challenge?

The babysitting is only available for paladin PCs or for non-evil aligned PC's with reputation higher than 12. Evil PCs can bully the mother away, which will lead to a follow-up.

At the Nashkel carnival, you can find Tina. The young woman is another tragic soul in need of some money... or so she says.


4. Monster in Nashkel 
------
Near the Manor House in Nashkel you can save little Arnim from a monster that's chasing him. He is staying with his parents in the Nashkel Inn. For such a heroic deed, the thankfulness of his parents should be all yours... shouldn't it?

The delivery man who mixed up the egg deliveries will be met later in the game. One of his customers is very, very unhappy about what he got and both will be delighted to see you. 

Note: The "stone" the delivery man gives the group is already spoiled (too warm). If the egg is handled or destroyed in any way, the original customer can no longer be met on the road.


5. Fallen Paladin in Baldur's Gate 
------
In the northern part of the city, in the temple of Helm, an evil fallen paladin is hiding. He slaughtered a little girl without hesitation... at least that's what the angry people in front of the temple are saying.


6. Undying Love in the Fishing Village 
------
The frightened woman in the left house tells you she is threatened by a monster hiding behind her house. Maybe you should go and take a look?


7. Lovesick Half-Orc 
------
On the road north of Nashkel, you meet Uguth. He is on his way to Baldur's Gate, to his beloved. Due to his appearance, being clearly descended from orcs, he has to overcome a special hindrance before he can take her into his arms.


8. Unexpected Help 
------
In the Candlekeep infirmary, glum Sir Trun seeks healing from his wounds. He was injured badly in a fight, but that doesn't seem to be his actual problem, as Linda, his fiancee who is staying in Candlekeep Inn, can tell you...
This quest is accessible both during the Prologue or after the return to Candlekeep. Note: Since most players finish this quest in the prologue, there are no NPC reactions for this quest.

Note: The "Extension of Bjornin Encounter" is moved to "bg1re: Romantic Encounters for BG1" where it belongs.


9. Many little paws 
------
Formerly meant as an Easter Egg quest I figured it makes sense to tell players it's actually there. Make sure you have Minsc in your party when talking to the vendor at the Nashkel Carnival. Everything else will develop from there - promise!

Spoiler:
The pet vendor will reappear after three ingame days at the 3rd level of the Friendly Arm Inn.


10. Drunk near Beregost Temple 
------
Inform the priests in Beregost Temple about the drunken wannabe Lich outside so they can keep an eye on his safety!


11. A Warm Place for Noober 
------
Approximately three days after the first Noober contact in Nashkel, your PC will witness an oxymoron: a Noober who cannot talk! Show mercy and find a kind soul ready to take him in and help him to cure his sickness - and also a place where, finally, Noober can put his talkativeness into good use, as well.


12. Brage's Sword (not for original BG1) 
------
This component gives the player the possibility to prove that Brage fell victim to an intrigue and save him from a death by the gallows - if the PC wants to. There is an evil quest option, of course.
Brage has to be brought to Nashkel alive. The mod also adds the possibility to bring him to Oublek (i.e. the Nashkel authorities) instead of to the temple. This was unfinished original game content. (For this possibility, please note the install order as mentioned below).

The quest about Brage's sword starts when talking to Oublek after bringing Brage to Nashkel alive.

Note: Since Version 30, the quest extensions by Brage's Redemption mod with additional hints and journal entries are now included in bgqe.
The mod "Brage's Redemption" (v10 and higher) requires bgqe's component "Brage's Sword" as a prerequirement before Brage can be taken into the party, i.e. if both mods are installed, BGQE has to be installed before Brage's Redemption.
BGQE should be installed before Brage's Redemption.
BGQE should be installed before BG1NPC Project or some of the added reply options to Brage and Borda will be lost.

The merchant Borda (original game content) plays a role in this quest. Originally, he can be met in the area with the Xvart village. Depending on quest status the PC can confront him here. If he was already met, there will be a second meeting.
Brage's cursed sword plays a role, as well. It has to be presented to Nalin at some point. After that, it is no longer needed for this mod (and can e.g. be used for Thalantyr's Item Upgrade Mod).
The quest can be solved completely before clearing the Nashkel mines but it can also be solved later.

***** Walkthrough *****
For the quickest way of solving the quest (especially before going into the mines), the walkthrough is as follows:

- On the map with the Xvart village, talk to the merchant Borda. For the quickest way, you can confront him and kill him to get the needed note and Brage's real sword. This is not necessary to solve the quest before the Nashkel mines, though.
- Go to Brage. If Borda is not killed, let Laryssa live to be able to solve the quest before clearing the Nashkel mines. Bring Brage to Nashkel alive (either to the temple or to Oublek does not matter)
- Talk to Oublek and receive the quest "Captain Brage's Guilt".
- Show the cursed two-handed sword to priest Nalin in Nashkel temple to prove it is cursed.
- If Borda was not killed yet, meet Laryssa outside the temple and receive a clue about a merchant at the Nashkel Carnival. He is located in the tent far south.
- Tell Oublek about the cursed sword.
- If Borda is still alive, go to the potions merchant at the Nashkel Carnival (far south tent) and confront him with the accusations until he tells where to meet Borda.
- Search for Borda. If not met yet, he will be in the area with the Xvart village. If already met there, go into the Lotus tent in the far west of the Carnival once. Upon leaving the tent, Borda will confront the group. Take the letter and the sword after defeating him.
- Give Oublek the letter to prove Brage's innocence.
- Talk to Oublek again to trigger the Brage's trial cutscene.
- After clearing his name, Brage will be inside the temple in Nashkel. Persuade him to take his real sword.
- After Brage took his sword and the PC left the temple once and returns, Nalin will address the PC that Brage wants to speak with them. Brage will ask to join and can be taken into the group.

Note: For the case that the merchant Borda was not killed upon the first meeting but Laryssa, Brage's cousin, was killed upon the first confrontation, the last needed quest clue will be found no sooner than Tazok's tent in the bandits' camp.


13. Legal Seachart Sources (not for original BG1) 
-------
This component adds two more possibilities to receive the sea charts for Mendas' trip to Balduran's island. Both ways will be installed. 
13.A by Lumorus: If the PC helped Aldeth Sashenstar in the Cloakwood as well inside the Merchants' League, Aldeth will be very interested in the research and Balduran's artefacts. He will enable access to the sea charts without the need to steal them or intoxicate the captain.
13.B CALABALD (= Calahan + Balduran's Island) by Shuv-Oohl: The sailor Calahan in Ulgoth's Beard wouldn't be a real sailor if he wouldn't have sea charts of his own. He won't part with them without an appropriate compensation, though... PCs with enough gold have now the possibility to go to Balduran's island before entering Baldur's Gate.


14. Additions to the House of the Lady and the Bitch Queen's Temple 
-------
This component extends the original game quest about priest Tremain's dead son and the scoll of dispel from the temple of Umberlee.
14.A Prevent Jalanthe from Making a Mistake, by Lumorus: The High Priest of the Water Queen requests a Book of Wisdom for the scroll of dispel. But would it really be a wise idea for her to rely on another god's help? The PC now can ask explicitly whether the priestess is sure that Umberlee would be pleased if the ceremony was done with the wisdom received by Tymora... 
14.B Tremain's Sellout: in the original game, Tremain asks the PC to retrieve his dead son from the temple of Umberlee, so he can revive him. The PC now has the possibility to bring the son to the temple, instead. 


15. A worried farmer (not for original BG1), by Lumorus and White Agnus
-------
In Beregost/Nashkel there are some rumors by a few farmers, so far one of them is addressed in this component: talk to a farmer in Beregost until he tells the PC about a creature making noises behind his house at night. He will then ask the PC to help him to get rid of it.


16. Bodies for a good cause, by Lumorus and White Agnus
-------
This mod plays in Baldur's Gate. Bring the corpses you find in the sewers to Sylar, a necromancer with a special research. This component is also good for PCs that care about the environment! :D


17. Finish Cordyr's Quest without killing Sil, by Lumorus
-------
This component expands on Cordyr's Quest twofold:
-The door to his house will be unlocked and all PCs no matter the reputation will get the quest to take care of the sirines who took over Cordyr's old fishing grounds.
-The conflict can be solved without having to kill Sil and the sirines.

This component is compatible with all changes to Sil and her sirines by bg1re and Lure of Sirine's Call.


18. Improved Borda (BGT, BG:EE, EET)
------
This component makes the fight with the merchant Borda more difficult. Changes are: wand of sleep (5 charges), potion of invisibility, Potion of power, and a custom mage script that makes use of the items. On the other hand: magic resistance reduced to 0%, removing of the script that lets him initiate dialogue.

These changes were part of the component "Brage's Sword" but are now an own component that can also be installed independently.

The component is compatible with component 12: "Brage's Sword".



INSTALLATION

Note: If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, uninstall all previously installed components and delete the mod folder and executables. When installing or uninstalling, do not close the DOS window by clicking on the X button! Instead, press the Enter key when instructed to do so.


BGII:EE
If you use BG Enhanced Edition from GOG or Steam, you need to prepare your game before installing any mods:

(deprecated tool: 
https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/50441/modmerge-merge-your-steam-gog-zip-based-dlc-into-something-weidu-nearinfinity-dltcep-can-use/p1)

 
General (Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux)
Make sure you back up your game acordingly, just to be sure. 

Extract the contents of the mod archive to your game's main directory. 
NOTE: For BG:EE it is important that you istall the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.


Windows
On successful extraction, there should be an bgqe folder and a setup-bgqe.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click setup-bgqe.exe and follow the instructions on screen.
Run setup-bgqe.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.

Mac OS X
If properly extracted, you should have a bgqe folder, setup-bgqe, and setup-bgqe.command in your game's main directory folder. To install, simply double-click setup-bgqe.command and follow the instructions on screen.

Linux
Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from WeiDU.org and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your BG installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you have already ran it once in the same directory. If you are unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.
Run WeInstall setup-bgqe in your game folder to install the mod. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing.


NOTE: BG(II):EE are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. 


If you have installation problems or encounter any bugs, please post your bug report in one of the forum threads given below.

COMPATIBILITY

Baldur's Gate Mini Quests and Encounters Mod is coded using WeiDU and does not overwrite any files. It should be compatible with most other (WeiDU) mods. 

BG1NPC Project: the component "Brage's Sword" from bgqe has to be installed before the BG1NPC Project or some reply options in Brage's original dialogue might not show.

Brage's Redemption: The component "Brage's Sword" is a prerequirement for the mod "Brage's Redemption". BGQE needs to be installed before Brage's Redemption.

bg1re: fully compatibility of all components (I'm putting this here because both mods change Sil's dialogue)

Lure of Sirine's Call: fully compatibility of all components (I'm putting this here because both mods change Sil's dialogue)


If you play it with the original BG, the mod is compatible with
-Echon's "Field of the Dead" (Version 1.07)

The mod should also be technically compatible with (this does not necessarily imply that the listed mods are all compatible with each other):
-BG1 Unfinished Business
-BG1 Adventure and CoM Forge
-BG1 Ajantis Expansion Mod
-bg1re BG1 Romantic Encounters
-Grey Clan Episode 1
-Herbs and Potions Add-In
-DSotSC (BGT/EET version)
-Lure of Sirine's Call
-NTotSC 
-Xan Friendship Mod




KNOWN ISSUES

-"Many little paws" I am also sometimes left with one or two hamsters after the boy supposedly takes them all, although which ones exactly differs each try. (I hope this will be fixed for v16)

-"Brage's Sword" (BG:EE / EET): after returning Brage to Nashkell, the journal entry "The Tale of Captain Brage(Finished)" will remain in the journal, but without any text attached to it. Obviously the journal system is not meant to remove titels even if the entries are removed. This is an engine problem. (MIght be fixed in EE v2.6.xx).

-"A Warm PLace for Noober" (BG1:TotSC): It can happen that Joseph's widow's mother will sleep on the floor, while a generic sleeping woman sleeps in the bed. Just imagine Joseph's widow to have a real great heart for needing souls.

-"Drunk near Beregost Temple" (BG1:TotSC): Polus the drunk still preforms his silly folk dance when you talk to him (falls down on the ground and gets up 15 or so times).

--Merchant League Signature Ring's Luck effect will no longer stack with itself. ("Legal Seachart Sources")

Version 20:
-added updated full Russian translation by d0lphin
-Tulbor should (really!) give the cheap alternative after the PC bought it

Version 19:
-"Slimequest":  Tulbor should give the antidotes after the PC bought them; "neutral" ending gives solved quest entry now, too.
-"A warm place for Noober": added a general question to Joseph's wife to make it less awkward that the PC cannot ask about help for Noober if woman is spoken to first time - not to overwrite her first dialogue. This will lead to receiving the quest about her husband. If spoken to again, the Noober quest will proceed.
-typo fixes 
-added REQUIRE_PREDICATE GAME_IS just to make sure.
-added DESIGNATED numbers to components to detect Brage's Sword correctly

--the boy will remain at the carnival until the quest is finished and all little hamsters are given to him
--fix: boy should take all hamsters that are in inventory

-"Lovesick Half-Orc": the commoner talking about an orc attack won't be named as a female any more 

-"Babysitting Quest": some more safety tweaks to make sure all kids and toys leave with the mother 

-"Drunk near Beregost Temple": rephrased journal entry to make it clear the drunk stays in the area

-"A Warm Place for Noober": quests now closes in case Joseph's widow is dead, too; tweaked the widow's dialogue a litle in case PC visits for the first time after Noober is already recovered; quest journal entry will be removed in case PC visits for the first time after Noober is already recovered; (BG1:TotSC) Noober should respawn for original BG1 now, too.

-moved all install-mrk files into the backup folder (except for utf-8 conversion)

-splitted game text and setup text into two separate tra files
